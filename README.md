# My-first-full-stack-application---yt2MP3-converter

//Wanted to create a Youtube to MP3 converter and deploy it.
Found a really cool set of videos from a youtube channel called web dev tutorials and followed through.
Part of the course was deploying using git

I usually run tutorials when having to learn a language so I get familiar with how the different aspects come togehter for code.
I used this project to learn JavaScript on the backend with HTML and CSS sprinkled in for the front end.

The front end is a CSS template not designed by me. Made it easy to have an interactive front end. I think this will be the first thing that I change.
Will also use similar logic to create my next project which is a tiktok to MP4 downloader for those tiktoks that have download disabled. Hopefully I find a free API for this
